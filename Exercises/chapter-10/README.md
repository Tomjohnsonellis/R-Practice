## Exercise 1: Creating data frames
Time to start making spreadsheets!
```
df <- data.frame(vector_1,vector_2)
cbind(df, new_vector)
rownames(df, index_vector)
```

## Exercise 2: Working with data frames
Practice makes perfect, ideally I should be so comfortable with dataframes that working with them feels natural
```
runif()
rownames()
mean()

```

## Exercise 3: Working with built-in data sets
Some more $ notation, and working with some US spending data!

## Exercise 4: External data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants
Read in a csv and explore the data
```
getwd()
setwd()
readcsv()
```
