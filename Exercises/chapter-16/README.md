## Exercise 1: ggplot2 basics
Finally making some graphs! The pretty part of data science.
```
my_dataset %>%
ggplot() +
geom_type(mapping = aes(x,y))
```

## Exercise 2: Advanced ggplot2 practice
Some more graphs, log scaling, colours, storing a graph as a variable, the works!
Scatterplots, violins, heatmaps, bar charts and even a Coxcomb chart!
