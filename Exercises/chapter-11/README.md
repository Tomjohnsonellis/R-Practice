## Exercise 1: Working with data frames (review)
I'm now much better at quickly focusing in on specific parts of data frames!

## Exercise 2: Working with `dplyr`
Now that I'm used to base R's syntax, time to switch to a completely different syntax!
dplyr is actually quite close to English so the change wasn't too bad
```
select()
filter()
mutate()
```
## Exercise 3: Using the pipe operator
There are always different methods of doing things, dplyr is no different, in this exercise we try 3 different ways of doing the same thing, and time them!
```
start_time <- proc.time
code_code_code
proc.time - start_time
```
## Exercise 4: Practicing with dplyr
More fun with pipes! This exercise works with flight data.
```
%>%
```

## Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations
More complex operations, using real world flight data.

## Exercise 6: dplyr join operations
Joining data frames and asking questions about groups of data!
```
left_join()
```
